## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS Framework

### What I learned

One of the reason I switched from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS is the ability to cusomize my projects easily. Tailwind provides the config.js file where you can customize your heart out.

### Continued development

I will be using Tailwind CSS in my future projects. The easy of use and the custom ability of it.
